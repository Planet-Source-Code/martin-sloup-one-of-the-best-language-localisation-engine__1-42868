I wrote this language engine, when i needed multilanguage
support for my one application. Lot of multilanguage engines
isn't good, bud this is by my opinion one from the best.
It supports varibles, index of controls and all keys in
controls. 

For example: (all of this is supported)

frmMain.lblMain.Caption="My Caption"
frmMain.lblArray(0).Caption="Caption 0"
frmMain.lblArray(1).Caption="Caption 1"
frmMain.ToolBar.ButtonToolTipText(4)="About"

Varibles are use this:
Var <form_name>.<varible_name>="<value>"

Look on the test source. Vote please for me.
This is my first posted source on Planet Source Code.
Thanks you. 

Warnings for all: My mother tongue is czech.
